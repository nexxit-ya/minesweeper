# Minesweeper

Classic game, where you need to find all mines on the field

### Main logic:
1. You can click anywhere
2. If you click on bomb - you lose 
3. If you click on empty cell - you see number of bombs around this cell
4. If there are no bombs near - you'll see empty cells around
5. If you click on cell with number - you'll see number of bombs around this cell
6. If there are no bombs near - you can click on any cell

### Sprites
There are currently 3 sprites:
- for bomb
- for flag
- for number 1 (to mark cells with boms that are near)

### TODO:
- [x] Add number sprites
- [ ] Sophisticate logic further
- [ ] Add difficulty [OPTIONAL]
